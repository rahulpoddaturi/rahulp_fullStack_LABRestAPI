Demo of various operations using different login

I have created 2 user 
1. admin - with ADMIN role 
2. rahul - with USER role 

These are added manually to the database. 


A User is permitted to view/save the students 
An ADMIN is allowed to any operation. 


firstly I am going to login using the USER role 
We are able to see that only the view and save worked,
As a USER was denied the access to Update and delete action. 


Now I am going to login as Admin  and perform all the actions 

As you can see we are able to perform all the curd operations. 

Thank you
